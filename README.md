I'm Yuan, a game developer, work at [Garena](https://www.garena.sg/) for a living, previously as a fresh graduate at
[Lilith Games](https://www.lilith.com/) and a few other companies(NOT good places anyway). I also work on my own projects in my spare time (I wanna post the website here, but not ready).
